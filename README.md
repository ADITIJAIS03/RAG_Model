# RAG_Model
RAG Model Simulator (Personalized Data Augmentation). A client-side app that demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Upload custom documents (PDF, MD, TXT) for knowledge grounding. The app retrieves relevant context chunks, passes them to the Gemini LLM, and generates accurate, grounded answers, preventing LLM hallucination.
